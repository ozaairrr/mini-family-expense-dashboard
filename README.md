# **Family Expense Tracker Dashboard**

## **📊 Project Overview**

This project demonstrates a **fully-automated, real-time family expense dashboard**. The core focus is on the clarity of **dashboard insights**—not on manual entry or spreadsheet maintenance.

- **Why?**  
  My older brother disliked updating Excel daily, so I built him an easy web interface to log expense data simply (using AI for smarter UX)—but **the main innovation is the dashboard analysis and automation**, not the website itself.

## **🚀 Dashboard Features**

- **Live Insights**: See categorized expense breakdowns, cash/ATM management, monthly and daily spending, and category-wise donut and bar charts automatically.
- **Leaderboard**: Instantly view top spenders, largest categories, and which family member drove most costs by period.
- **Expense Trends**: Visualize expense spikes, recurring patterns, and savings/investment opportunities with time-based trend graphs.
- **Cash Management**: Real ATM withdrawal/cash remaining calculations, removing all confusion about “where did the cash go?”
- **Fast Filtering**: Drill down to any month or even by custom day; see all data update instantly.
- **Minimal Manual Work**: Once data is inserted via the frontend website, everything else updates and calculates automatically.

## **🔗 How it Works**

- All data is **entered through a website** I built—no spreadsheets, just quick web forms anyone in the family can use (especially helpful for people who aren't fans of Excel).
- **The dashboard is the product**—the site is just an entry tool to make that possible easily.

## **🎯 Main Focus**

- The **dashboard analytics**, not the website, are the heart of this project.
- Designed so busy/non-tech family members can track, understand, and improve spending at a glance.
- The dashboard reveals patterns, tracks goals, and drives smarter financial decisions.
