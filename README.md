# **Family Expense Tracker Dashboard(Mini Project)**
## **🎯 The Problem**

My older brother was frustrated with tracking family expenses in Excel—he found it tedious, time-consuming, and not user-friendly. He wanted a simple way to log daily expenses and immediately see **where the money was actually going** through clear visual insights.

## **💡 The Solution**

I built him a **user-friendly website** where he could quickly enter expense data without any spreadsheet hassle. The data flows from the website → **Supabase database** → **Power BI dashboard**, giving him the financial insights he wanted.
